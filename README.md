# COSC140 lab setup

## Please answer these questions

### What is one thing that has surprised you so far in Cardiff?

One thing that has surprised me in Cardiff is the general structure of the university. At Colgate, there was a constant stream of work and finals, but in the majority of my courses here, I only have a final or a handful of big assignments spread throughout the semester. It is honestly very refreshing.

### What are three things that you hope to get out of your study abroad experience this semester?

-I hope to meet new people in the university and develop meaningful relationships with them. 
-I hope to learn valuable skills in my courses that will help me imrpove my resume and open the doors to new computer science opportunities. 
-I hope to travel the island and hopefully main-land Europe to experience new cultures and be the first in my family to really make a continental trip. 

## Feedback

The academic difference is definitely quite interesting, and I'm glad it's refreshing to you!
